     Carrie Hott is an artist, designer, and educator who works in multiple mediums, ranging from installation and video to websites and publications. Her work focuses on opaque technological systems and how these impact on our sense of self, time, and agency. Through her work she sets up shared experiences that question how technological infrastructure is made legible, and by whom. </p>

     She collaborates widely and values multiple perspectives, voices, and entry points in her work in order to best reflect systems that are larger than all of us, and impact each of us in unique ways. She currently co-stewards the project How To Slow Internet, which is focused on collaborative experimentation with small scale communication technology in order to better consider the large scale communications infrastructure on which we increasingly depend. </p>
