    <p>
      I am an artist, designer, educator, and curator. My practice is predominantly focused on researching opaque technological systems and their impact on our sense of self, time, and agency. My practice is intentionally shapeshifting, multimedia, and collaborative. I believe in incorporating multiple perspectives, voices, and entry points in my work because I research systems that are larger than all of us, but impact each of us in unique ways.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      I am an artist who researches designed systems, and I create work that uses design. I am equally drawn to the form of a power plant as I am to the experience of a haunted house.  </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      I am currently based in Bloomington, Indiana where I am Assistant Professor of Graphic Design in the Studio Art program at the Eskenazi School of Art, Design, and Architecture at Indiana University, Bloomington.
