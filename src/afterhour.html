            <p>Multi Media Installation</p>
            <p>completed at <a href="https://www.interfaceartgallery.com/carrie-hott-after-hour/" target="_blank" class="link">Interface Gallery in Oakland, CA</a> in 2015</p>
            <br>
            <p>Created to echo a closed lamp shop, perpetually after hours, After Hour was an atmosphere of the end of the day, all the time.</p>

            <p>Accompanying the installation was a site-specific sound created with musician Laura Steenberge by using glass lamps as instruments, set to mark a rhythm and then crescendo in intervals to mark the passing of a work-day clock.</p>

            <p>"Taking the architecture and the location into account, Hott constructed a fictitious store of her own imagining for her exhibition, housing conceptual sculpture and sound focusing on her continued investigation with light. For almost five years, Hott has been investigating light’s history and light emanating objects, such as lamps. Recently she has been researching black outs. In an email exchange she explained, “I've been following this meandering path of artificial light, blackouts, and the web of social experiences of each form. Artificial light can be an organizer, while blackouts can be an equalizer.” After-Hour focuses on light at night as social exchange."
