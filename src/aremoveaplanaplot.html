            <p>Multi Media Installation</p>
            <p>Completed at the SF Arts Commission Gallery in San Francisco, CA</a> in 2016</p>
            <br>

            <p>A Remove, A Plan, A Plot was a multi media installation that envisioned a space in a fictional future after the existing gallery where it was located has closed. Located next to and facing San Francisco City Hall, the installation represents a transitional planning space where there is no power supply from the city, so all electronics are solar powered.</p>

        
            <p>"At 155 Grove Street, the San Francisco Arts Commission’s window gallery currently contains A Remove, A Plan, A Plot, a silver-lined meeting space with furniture painted in primer gray, powered by solar energy and full of wayward wires.</p>

            <p>A Remove, A Plan, A Plot proposes a future use for the SFAC’s former gallery space as an off-the-grid gathering place for planning and plotting. Whether the plans involve the next window gallery display, or something more sinister aimed across the street at City Hall, Hott’s installation doesn’t say, though blue-tinged surveillance-like videos have a tendency to look like they’re up to no good."</p>
